Dear Investors, [url=http://onasander.com/bounty.html]Onasander Investment Bank Bounty Campaign[/url] has started. We are mega happy to announce one of the biggest Bounty programs in the ICO history that will enable early investors to get access to our tokens. Therefore, we would like to provide our supporters an opportunity to be rewarded for generating awareness with the introduction of a bounty program. Our Bounty program starts now and lasts until February 23, 2019. We plan on [b]offering 5% of total tokens[/b] for sale in our [url=http://Onasander.com/bounty.html]Bounty Campaign[/url].  The current campaign offers [b]3.5% ($2,500,000)[/b] of tokens, and we reserved addition [b]1.5% ($1,190,000)[/b] of tokens for future campaigns. Below is the breakdown: 

[center][url=http://onasander.com/bounty.html][img]http://onasander.com/images/bounty/intro.png[/img][/url][/center]

Our Bounty program is extensive. There is something for everyone. Make sure not to compare our offer by percentage as we offer way more bounties and way more tokens with much higher value. We offered a lot, because we are doing this together and we want our ICO Investment Bank to succeed. The idea of having a global investment fund run on a decentralized smart contract platform is too cool to resist. We want our endeavor to over achieve on all fronts. Help us build tomorrow's way of investing.
